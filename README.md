## Wordle Solver
A script that aims to reduce the amount of turns it takes to guess the daily word puzzle for Wordle. 

Created as a complete overthink of the process, and completely for fun. 

Current average correct guess sits at 4 tries. 

# How to use it
- When the program asks for letter progress, use the following:
    - 0 for not in the word
    - 1 for in the word, but not in the right place
    - 2 for in the word and in the right place
